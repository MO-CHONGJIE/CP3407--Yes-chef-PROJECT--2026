# CP3407--Yes-chef-PROJECT--2026

Project Background
====================

With the popularization of food delivery and online ordering platforms, users often encounter problems such as difficulty in making choices, overload of menu information, and insufficient personalization during the ordering process. Traditional food ordering systems usually only provide basic menu browsing and ordering functions, lacking intelligent analysis of users' preferences, eating habits and historical behaviors.

Yes-chef-PROJECT is a modern ordering system that integrates artificial intelligence recommendation technology, proposed under this background, aiming to provide users with a smarter, more personalized and more efficient ordering experience.
